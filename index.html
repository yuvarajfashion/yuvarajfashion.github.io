                <p class="para">Although it is also used for womenswear, the drafting method is more commonly employed in menswear and involves drafting a pattern directly onto pattern paper using a variety of straightedges and curves. Since menswear rarely involves draping, pattern-making is the primary preparation for creating a cut-and-sew woven garment. The initial measurements and adjustments are created on paper as a draft. More paper is placed over top of the draft and traced off with seam allowance added to these pieces, which will then be cut out and used to cut out actual fabric for sewing. If this draft will be frequently used, a sloper is created to speed up the production time. A pattern maker would use various tools such as a notcher, drill and awl to mark the pattern in places. A custom dressmaker frequently employs one of three pattern creation methods. The flat-pattern method begins with the creation of a sloper or block, a basic pattern for a fitted,jewel-neck bodice and narrow skirt, made to the wearer's measurements. The sloper is usually made of lightweight cardboard or tagboard, without seam allowances or style details. Once the shape of the sloper has been refined by making a series of mock-up garments called toiles (UK) or muslins (US), the final sloper can be used in turn to create patterns for many styles of garments with varying necklines, sleeves, dart placements, and so on.</p>
